            <h1> TinkerCAD simulation </h1>
            <p>
                Before testing out the circuit on the breadboard, I first used a electronic
                simulation website known as TinkerCAD to see wether my circuit works.
                Before creating the actual circuit on the website, I first calibrate my virtual
                LDR with the starter code provided by TinkerCAD. After that, I connected the
                circuit together and it works.

            <h1> Breadboard testing </h1>
            <p>
                After trying out on TinkerCAD, I connected the circuit together on a breadboard.
                <br><br>
                I first get the LDR from fablab. Then, using the starter code found in TinkerCAD, I 
                calibrated the LDR.
                <br><br>
                Then, I started to connect the actual circuit together.
                At first the circuit does not really work on a breadboard. I slowly figure
                out that the toggle switch used is not meant for breadboard. So, I decided to connect
                a jumper wire directly from Vcc or GND depending on wether i want it to be 'on' or 'off'.
                This time, the circuit works perfectly.

                <h1> Actual stripboard connection </h1>
                <p> 
                        After trying out the circuit on the breadboard, I decided to solder
                        the circuit onto the stripboard. As my stripboard has no layout, I have
                        to solder jumper wires to every node of the circuit. However, I still
                        prefer to use a no-layout stripboard. This is because I do not need
                        to break the layout of the stripboard. Although this is my second time
                        soldering in my whole life and my first time soldering for a graded
                        assignment, I am able to get the circuit working on my first attempt
                        abliet with some desoldering here and there.

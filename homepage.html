                Welcome to my CA2 Assignment website!
                <br>
                <br>
                This website serves to document the works and progress of my electronic
                assignment.
                <br><br> 
                The electronic assignment that I am doing is a concept prototype for a automatic sun shade depolyment system.
                A brief summary on how it works is that when the sun shines on the two LDRs on the circuit board, the
                microcontroller will send a signal to a servo motor to turn 90 degrees, effectively deploying the shade.
                When the sun sets, the microcontroller will send a signal to the servo motor to turn to 0 degrees, retracting
                the sun shade. The threshold analog input is set to a value high enough that the shade will not be deployed
                unless during a sunny day, preventing situations such as deployment of shade when the LDRs are placed under
                for example, a street light.

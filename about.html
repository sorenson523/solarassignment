            <h1> Synopsis </h1>
            <p>
                On a bright sunny day, the interior of the car tends to heat up and get warm. This is because the car acts as a mini
                greenhouse, which traps infra-red radiation from the sun. The surface of the car tends to heat up first especially it is
                of dark and dull colour. In turn, the heated surface will set up a convection current, causing the interior of the car
                to get extremely warm. A common method employed to solve this issue is the sun shade. Normally put up while the car is
                stationary, the sun shade reflects the light away from the car interior, preventing the abovementioned situation.
                However, sometimes the owner may be in a hurry, and thus could not afford waste time putting up the sun shade. Another
                possible situation is whereby a user simply forgets about the sun shade. Thus, to solve this problem, I am proposing an
                automatic sun shade deployment system. During a sunny day, this system will automatically deploy the sun shade.
